## Challenge Summary

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-8 mb-12">
  <div class="w-full md:w-[65%] mb-6 md:mb-0">
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">For this week's creative sprint, you're invited to step into the role of an AI-powered storyteller. Your challenge is to create a children's story from scratch — and bring it to life with AI.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">You'll write the story, generate visuals (or an animation), and present it however you want: as a picture book, a short film, an audiobook, a zine, or something weird we've never seen before.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">The vibe is up to you! It can be:</p>
    <ul class="space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>Wholesome and bedtime-friendly</li>
      <li>Full of lessons and morals</li>
      <li>Totally deranged and adult-in-disguise à la Nobody Poops But You</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">The only rule is: make it feel like a children's story, whether real or twisted.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg">Use this challenge to experiment with narrative structure, image generation, video tools, voice synthesis, and your own sense of humor.</p>

## Inspiration

You could go cute, creepy, cozy, or cursed. Here are some jumping-off points:

### You might create...

- A picture book about a cat who owns a startup and loses it all
- A short film about a lonely toaster who dreams of becoming a jazz musician
- A sci-fi bedtime story narrated by a glitchy AI grandma
- An illustrated guidebook to monsters that live in your closet and pay rent
- A poetic fable about emotions that live in the clouds and cry rain down on Earth
- A surreal, Ghibli-style animated short about a goose who wants to become a linebacker for the Raiders

You can write your story using GPT-4, Claude, or on your own. For visuals, explore Midjourney, DALL·E, or Kling.ai (for animation). Combine formats if you want — a narrated slideshow, an illustrated poem, a 3D flipbook, or something else entirely.

Anything that brings the story to life.
