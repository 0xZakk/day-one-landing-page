## Challenge Summary

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-8 mb-12">
  <div class="w-full md:w-[65%] mb-6 md:mb-0">
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">For this week's creative sprint, you're invited to become an <strong>AI-powered archivist</strong> — building a digital field guide for anything you care about.</p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your challenge is to find or invent a <strong>fixed dataset</strong> — whether it's every pasta shape, every Studio Ghibli film, or all the species on your imaginary planet — and turn it into something others can explore. This could be a Pokedex-style site, a searchable API, a minimalist visual encyclopedia, or a strange little tool for diving into weird data.</p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">The core of the challenge is twofold: the <strong>corpus you choose</strong>, and the <strong>way you bring it to life</strong>. You can scrape data, generate it, remix public datasets, or compile your own from scratch. Then, use whatever tools you want — design, code, AI, no-code — to make the dataset feel alive.</p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your index can be <strong>useful</strong>, <strong>beautiful</strong>, <strong>nostalgic</strong>, <strong>absurd</strong>, or all of the above. What matters is that you treat the data with care, and give people a reason to get lost in it.</p>

## Inspiration

There’s no one way to build an index. Yours can be functional, nostalgic, absurd, or all of the above. Below are some ideas to spark your thinking — feel free to remix or ignore them entirely.

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-8 mb-12">
  <div class="w-full md:w-[65%] mb-6 md:mb-0">
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">You might create…</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>A minimalist Pokedex-style site cataloging extinct animals, complete with AI-generated visuals</li>
      <li>A searchable API of every Studio Ghibli film, with filters for mood, snacks, and spirit animal companions</li>
      <li>A fictional explorer's guide to the 88 moons of Jupiter, complete with climate zones and local myths</li>
      <li>A cursed terminal interface that lets users browse every late-night infomercial product from the '90s</li>
      <li>A field guide to made-up fungi, with Latin names, AI art, and a toxicity index</li>
      <li>A zine of classic pasta shapes, each one paired with a generative haiku and a historical footnote</li>
      <li>A museum-style digital wall that shows every NPC in a video game, with lore, relationships, and alignment</li>
      <li>An open-source index of AI agents built by the community, with prompts, use cases, and live demos</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="w-full md:w-[35%]">
    <Image
      src={moons}
      alt="Fictional explorer's guide to the 88 moons of Jupiter"
      class="w-full h-auto max-h-[650px] object-contain"
    />
  </div>
</div>

To build your AI-Dex, you can use:
- GPT-4, Claude, or Perplexity for content generation  
- DALL·E, Midjourney, or Playground for visuals  
- Supabase, Vercel, or Airtable for data storage and hosting  
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Dust for retrieval-based interfaces  
- Or just plain HTML, a spreadsheet, and a good idea  

Use whatever tools help bring your dataset to life. Combine them however you want. The more it feels like a love letter to the data, the better.
